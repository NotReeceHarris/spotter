The idea is to increase the total weight lifted for each exercise each week. This doesnâ€™t necessarily mean changing the actual weight lifted; it could involve increasing the weight, adding an extra rep to a set, or adding an extra set.

## Example

**Bench Press**

- **Week 1:** 3 sets of 12 reps @ 60kg = 2160kg
- **Week 2:** 3 sets of 12 reps @ 63kg = 2268kg (an increase of 108kg from Week 1)
- **Week 3:** 4 sets of 12 reps @ 63kg = 3024kg (an increase of 756kg from Week 2, and 864kg from Week 1)

In just 3 weeks, we have indirectly added 864kg to the bench press total, which will promote muscle growth and strength gains, additionally using the push/pull/legs split that will double if you choose to do bench press for your second chest day.
