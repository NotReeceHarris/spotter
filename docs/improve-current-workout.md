### Improving Your Current Workout

#### Requirements
- Must already be on a regular split.

#### Steps
1. **Track 1 Week of Lifting:** Document your lifting routine for one week.
2. **Track Weight and Sets:** Record the weight lifted and the number of sets.
3. **Use Spotter Formula:** Calculate your "base spot" for each exercise.

#### Spotter Formula
1. **Calculate Base Spot:**
   - Multiply sets by weight: \( \text{base sets} \times \text{base weight} = \text{base spot} \)
   - Example: \( 12 \text{ sets} \times 60 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \)
2. **Increase Base Spot Weekly:**
   - Increase by 10% each week: \( \text{base spot} \times 0.1 \)
   - Example: \( 720 \times 0.1 = 72 \)
   - Add to the base spot: \( 720 + 72 = 792 \text{ kg} \)
3. **Adjust Sets and Weight:**
   - Ensure the total lifted weight approximates the new base spot.
   - For 72 kg increase, it might mean \( +5.91 \text{ kg} \) or 1 more rep per set.

#### Goals and Considerations
- **Gradual Increase in Intensity:** Add intensity each week to progressively build strength.
- **Avoid Overloading:** Adding too many reps over time can be suboptimal. Balance weight and reps for sustainable progress.

By following this approach, you can plan your exercises for the next year, ensuring continuous improvement and strength gains.
